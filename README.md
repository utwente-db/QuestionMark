# QuestionMark: the probabilistic benchmark


QuestionMark: the probabilistic benchmark is the Python program to benchmark any
probabilistic database management system. 

Currently, this program provides queries in the dialects of
[DuBio](https://github.com/utwente-db/DuBio) and [MayBMS](http://maybms.sourceforge.net/). 

To run this benchmark a dataset should be generated using
[QuestionMark: The Dataset Generator](https://gitlab.utwente.nl/s1981951/prob-matcher).

```This project is still a WIP. Please do not yet use.```

## Use
This project can be downloaded for use. Please check ```MANUAL.md``` for a roadmap on how
to run the benchmark tests.

This project may be adapted for own use. It is planned to release this work under a CC license.

Additional dialects could be added to wish. The ```queries-pseudo-code.txt``` can be used for convenient 
translation to any other dialect. Currently, QuestionMark is built with PostgreSQL-based databases in mind. 
Additional changes need to be made to this program in case another database system needs to be supported.
