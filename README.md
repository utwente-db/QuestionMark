# QUESTION MARK: the probabilistic benchmark - Dataset Generator

QUESTION MARK: the probabilistic benchmark - Dataset Generator is a Python program to create 
a dataset for probabilistic product matching. This dataset is required to run the benchmark 
test with the [QUESTION MARK: the probabilistic benchmark](https://gitlab.utwente.nl/s1981951/probabilistic-benchmark).

The dataset created by this program is an adaptation of the 
[WDC [database.ini.tmpl](database.ini.tmpl)Product Data Corpus for Large-Scale Product Matching](http://webdatacommons.org/largescaleproductcorpus/v2/index.html) 
dataset. The clustering provided by this original dataset is removed and a new probabilistic
clustering is introduced.

## Use
This project can be downloaded for use. Please check ```MANUAL.md``` for a roadmap on how
to generate the datasets with the desired size and amount of uncertainty.

This project may be adapted for own use. It is planned to release this work under a CC license.
