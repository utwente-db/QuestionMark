# prob-matcher

prob-matcher is a Python program to create a dataset for probabilistic product matching. 
The dataset created by this program is an adaptation of the 
[WDC Product Data Corpus for Large-Scale Product Matching](http://webdatacommons.org/largescaleproductcorpus/v2/index.html) 
dataset. The clustering provided by this original dataset is removed and a new probabilistic
clustering is introduced. The dataset created by this program can be loaded into both 
[DuBio](https://github.com/utwente-db/DuBio) and [MayBMS](http://maybms.sourceforge.net/).

```This project is still a WIP. Please do not yet use.```

## Use
This project can be downloaded for use. Please check ```MANUAL.md``` for a roadmap on how
to generate the datasets with the desired size and amount of uncertainty.

This project may be adapted for own use. It is planned to release this work under a CC license.
