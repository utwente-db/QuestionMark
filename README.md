# QuestionMark
QuestionMark is a set of two Python programs that can be used to benchmark any probabilistic database management system. The QuestionMark Benchmark for Probabilistic Databases is composed of the following two programs:
- _QuestionMark: The Dataset Generator_. This program generates the dataset that is to be used in QuestionMark: The Probabilistic Benchmark.
- _QuestionMark: The Probabilistic Benchmark_. This program runs the benchmark test. It contains a set of queries and metrics to provide a clear picture of the performance of any probailisictic DMBS.

To view and download the two projects, select either the branch _thedatasetgenerator_ or _theprobabilisticbenchmark_ and clone each branch in its own local repository. Follow the instructions provided by the manual in each project carefully.

Please see manual.pdf for more information on the project.
